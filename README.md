# MAKERMAKER

Browser CAD for workshop fabrication. Goals and decisions: [GOAL.md](GOAL.md); terms: [CAD_DEFINITIONS.md](CAD_DEFINITIONS.md).

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm test           # unit tests incl. geometry kernel in Node
npm run build      # typecheck + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve dist/ (service worker active, works offline after first load)
```

Chromium-based browsers only.

## Layout

- `src/doc` – document model (plain immutable data), expressions with units, undo history
- `src/kernel` – Replicad/OpenCascade build of bodies, runs in a Web Worker
- `src/viewer` – three.js viewport
- `src/ui` – panels
- `src/io` – `.mmk` design file (ZIP: `document.json` + `history/`), file access
- `public/sw.js` – offline cache

## Status

- Bodies are recipes of extrude steps: each has a sketch plane (ground / front / right plane with offset, or the top face of an earlier step), one or more profiles (rectangle with corner radius, circle, polygon), a depth and add / cut (cut: blind or through). Fillets/chamfers are the final layer.
- Sketch mode: New sketch (S or the toolbar's first tool) picks a top face or empty space, turns the camera to it and shows a grid; leaving the first pull of a direct shape flat (click or Esc) also enters it; Draw on a selected sketch reopens it. In sketch mode R / C / P draw flat into the sketch and the tool goes on; Esc stops the tool, Esc again or ✓ leaves. E in sketch mode shows the sketch's areas (overlapping shapes split into pieces, computed exactly by the kernel): click areas to pick them (double-click: everything inside the smallest shape there, overlaps and shapes inside it included), clicking a sketch in the list picks all of its areas; once something is picked a note at the pointer says to hit Enter; Enter or E pulls them into one extrusion linked to those areas (stored as inside / outside shapes, so they follow shape edits).
- Direct tools: R rectangle, C circle (cylinder), N regular polygon (diameter, Tab: number of sides; the first corner points at the pointer), P polygon, O sphere (drag from its centre on a face or the ground). Shapes keep their meaning (a hexagon stays a regular polygon with 6 sides).
- Bodies have a colour (picker in the body panel, swatch in the list; new bodies get one from a palette) and an eye to show / hide them like sketches; hidden bodies are still built but not drawn, picked or snapped to. Selected bodies glow.
- Help lines: any shape can be switched to a help line and back (dashed-line icon on its row, or the sketch-mode toolbar for selected shapes): drawn dashed, snapped to, never extruded (linked extrusions drop them).
- Pulling always makes a new body, also when drawn on another body's face (joining is a boolean, later); its sketch stays attached to that face, so the new body follows it.
- Sketches are objects (left list, eye to show/hide): shapes on a base plane or a body's face. R / C / P draw into the sketch under the pointer, the top face under it (that face's sketch), the selected sketch, or the base plane facing the camera; then pull right away (the pointer is hidden and locked, so pulling has no end; movement counts along the extrusion direction on screen), or click without pulling / Esc to keep the shape flat. E pulls the selected shapes (or the whole selected sketch). Extrusions stay linked to their sketch shapes (the broken-chain icon unlinks: copies the shapes into the step); shapes inside shapes are holes (even-odd). Ctrl snaps; the pointer snaps to corners and centres of all visible sketches and to body corners (big squircle), else to the nearest line: sketch outlines and body edges (the hit line lights up, small squircle), all projected onto the drawing plane; typed sizes and depth stay expressions. Selected shapes: drag to move in the sketch plane (axis wheel limited to the plane's two axes); a single shape gets incase-style handles (Alt from the middle, Shift proportional, Ctrl snaps, type a size, Tab other side) and a round handle to turn it (Shift 15°); only changed values are written, others keep their expressions. Two or more selected shapes: align left / centre / right / top / middle / bottom, distribute (three or more); ⌘D duplicates shapes (keeping expressions), arrows nudge them in their plane, Del deletes them.
- Fillets/chamfers select edges by rule (all/top/bottom/vertical) and survive dimension changes; failures name the step and keep the last valid geometry.
- Every numeric field accepts numbers, units (`3in`) and expressions with parameters (`2*ply + 10`); display units switch without changing geometry.
- Save in place (File System Access), open, drag & drop, undo/redo, offline startup; v1 files migrate to v2.
- Look at a face: the button under the view cube, then click a face; the camera looks straight at it (orthographic).
- Viewport and editing follow incase: view cube, per-view Ortho/Persp and Fit, drag a body to move it along X / Y / Z picked by the drag direction like a weapon wheel (shown at the press point; leave the dead zone ring to pick, go back through it to change; type a distance, Enter keeps, Esc undoes; Alt: free in the base plane facing the camera; Ctrl snaps 5 mm), cube drag with locked hidden pointer, Shift-click multi-select, Tab through bodies under the click, arrows nudge (Shift ×10), Del, ⌘D duplicate, Esc, drag a field or its label to scrub.
- Section viewer (from incase, plus Z): two-handle range per axis, invert, reset / double-click, hatched caps on cut faces; clicking a cut face picks its body. Custom sections (saved in the file): + Section (the button then reads "Click any face or plane"), click a face (hovered faces light up) or empty space for the base plane facing you; the plane lies on it (offset 0), removing the side towards the camera; name, on/off, offset, flip, delete.
- Autosave toggle: writes into the open file a moment after each change (Chromium; no history snapshot, ⌘S adds one).
- Icons and toolbar in incase's style.
- Not yet: sketches on side faces, face edits, editing profiles by dragging, instances, groups, quad view, imports/exports.
